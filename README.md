# Hello World! 🙌

I am Gabriel C. Troia – a passionate indi-preneur specializing in building web and mobile applications, (turn-based) games and open-source projects towards which I devote my heart and soul (no pun intended 😉)!

I built my career over the past 12+ years involved mostly in the startup world predominantly as a full-stack and mobile developer specialized in Javascript/Typescript, Node, React & React Native, NextJS and other amazing technologies in the Javascript ecosystem.

> Btw, I am available for hire on cool and/or impactful projects! [See below](#do-you-need-help-with-a-project)

**Realtime State Sync without the backend! 😎**

An Open-Source State Management and Synchronization library that abstracts the server-side and backend logic to share state between multiple users of your app. See more [here](https://movex.dev)!

### 🚀 I am also the Founder & Lead Software Developer at [Moves That Matter](https://github.com/movesthatmatter)

Where I get to work on third-party gigs, in-house ventures such as cool chess-like games (launching soon!) or open-source projects like Movex!

### 😁 And I used to be "The Chess Executive" at [Chessroulette.live](https://partner.chessroulette.live)

For about 2 years traveling the world and building it with the dream of creating an e-Sports Chess Platform where players and streamers can play competitively in tournaments and leagues. 

At our peak we grew into a team of 10 people and got to cover the 2021 World Chess Championship in collaboration with 10 Twitch streamers and host our first [Fundraising Tournament](https://fundraising-ukraine.chessroulette.live) for the children affected by the war in Ukraine, before we had to pause the business as I didn't manage to secure funding 🫠.

You can still see the [Promo Website](https://partner.chessroulette.live) or the now open-sourced [Web Repo](https://github.com/movesthatmatter/chessroulette-web).
