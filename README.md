### Hi there 👋

I am Gabriel! I am an Indiepreneur/Open-Source full-stack developer specialized in Javascript & Typescript technologies with 12+ years of experience.

I'm currently building [Movex](https://github.com/movesthatmatter/movex) –  a "predictable state container" for multiplayer apps or games, that allows the developer to focus on the front-end only, while it seamlessly takes care of the back-end.

If you'd like to help out by contributing, staring or giving any feedback please check the repo link https://github.com/movesthatmatter/movex or the landing page at https://movex.dev.
